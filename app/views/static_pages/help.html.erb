<h1>Bidding Help </h1>
<p>Once you have logged into your account, you can bid on any item by simply entering a bid of what you are willing to pay for the item. Please note that the minimum bid price is automatically listed in the bidding field. Your bid has to at least match the minimum listed bid. You can always bid more if you are willing to pay more for the item. When you place a bid higher than the minimum bid, the system will then automatically bid for you. Please note we will never place a bid that is higher than the bid you placed. Our system is designed to save you money and give you the best possible chance to win the auction at the lowest possible price. This way you can decide the maximum price you are willing to pay for an item and still have a good chance of winning the item at a lower price than your maximum bid.<br><br><br>Here is an example:<br>Another User (lets say User 1) places a bid of 200000 ₫. You place a bid of 300000 ₫. Now instead of your bid being put at 300000 ₫, our algorithm adjusts your bid down to210000 ₫. User 1 now places a bid of 250000 ₫. Our system then automatically bids the same amount for you, 250000 ₫, as you have already entered that you are willing to pay maximum 300000 ₫ for the item. You are still winning the auction at 250000 ₫. User 1 now places a bid of 300000 ₫ that matches your original bid. In this instance the system automatically matches User 1’s bid. You are still winning the auction with a bid of 300000 ₫. A good strategy can be to place a high maximum overall bid from the start, as it gives you a higher overall chance to win the auction, especially if another user only matches your bid. User 1 now places a bid of 310000 ₫. Now you have been outbid and User 1 occupies the winning position in the auction. If you wish to place another bid to occupy the winning position you will need to place a higher bid than 310000 ₫. As you can see, Chillindo is designed to help you win auctions at the best possible prices!</p>
